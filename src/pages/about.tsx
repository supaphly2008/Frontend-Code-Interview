          , a salon shop where I developed an efficient ticket dispenser system,
          available both online and onsite. This system enables hairdressers to
          effortlessly monitor the status of customers, while customers can
          conveniently check the queue status, including the number of people
          waiting. I have successfully developed a face recognition app that
          will maintain a record of customers' hairstyles. This will eliminate
          the need for customers to explain their desired hairstyle on
          subsequent visits, as the app will recognize and recall their
          preferences.
